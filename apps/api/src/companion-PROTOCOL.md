# Sarviq Companion App — Server Protocol v1 + Threat Model

Scope: remote control of the user's **own Sarviq PC instance** from the
**Sarviq companion app** on their phone (phone → PC). This is the REVERSE
of remote-phone v1 (`/api/phone/*`, PC → phone); the two namespaces are
independent and share no auth material.

What the app can do: view server health, active runs and pending approvals;
approve/deny tool approvals; pause/resume/cancel chat runs; read the
activity feed and the daily briefing; chat with a bot (same streaming
contract as the web UI); receive live pushes (run status, approvals,
activity hints) over a WebSocket.

## 1. Pairing flow (QR scan)

```
Web UI / API                    Phone app
  |  POST /api/companion/pairing/code  |
  |  (or GET /api/companion/pairing/qr)|
  |  { ott, qrPayload, expiresAt }     |
  |                                    |  user scans QR in the app
  |                                    |  sarviq://pair?host=<lan-ip>&port=<port>&token=<ott>
  |                                    |  POST /api/companion/pairing/exchange
  |                                    |  { ott, deviceName, platform? }
  |  { deviceToken, deviceId }          |
```

- The QR payload has two flavors:
  - LAN (default): `sarviq://pair?host=<lan-ip>&port=<port>&token=<ott>`
    (`host` = first non-internal IPv4, `port` = the API port).
  - Hosted: `sarviq://pair?url=<public-base-url>&token=<ott>` — used when
    the server is started with `SARVIQ_PUBLIC_URL` set (see §9). The phone
    then pairs over the internet instead of the LAN. The pairing responses
    also carry `mode: 'lan' | 'hosted'` and a human `serverLabel` so the
    web UI can show which network the QR encodes.
- The OTT is 128 bits of `crypto.randomBytes` (hex), **single-use**, expires
  in 5 minutes; at most 5 pending OTTs exist at once.
- `exchange` is rate-limited: 10 attempts per IP per 10 minutes → HTTP 429.
- The device token is 256 bits, handed to the phone **once** in the exchange
  response. The server stores only its SHA-256 hash (constant-time compare
  on use). Losing the token means re-pairing (delete + re-scan).
- Pairing proves physical proximity: the QR is displayed on the user's own
  screen and must be scanned within 5 minutes. There is no remote pairing
  path.

## 2. Auth

Every route except `POST /pairing/code`, `GET /pairing/qr` and
`POST /pairing/exchange` requires
`Authorization: Bearer <deviceToken>` → 401 otherwise. Revoking a device
(`DELETE /devices/:id`) drops its live push sockets immediately and its
token stops working at once.

`POST /api/chat` (the web chat endpoint) also accepts the companion Bearer
token — the app may call it directly with the exact body the web UI sends
(`{botId, message, sessionId, queueMode}`) and gets the same SSE stream.
Requests without an `Authorization` header behave exactly as before.

## 3. REST reference (all under `/api/companion`)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| POST | `/pairing/code` | `{ok, ott, qrPayload, expiresAt}` — no auth |
| GET | `/pairing/qr` | `{ok, qrPayload, expiresAt}` — no auth (UI renders the QR) |
| POST | `/pairing/exchange` | `{ott, deviceName, platform?}` → `{ok, deviceToken, deviceId}` — no auth |
| GET | `/devices` | Paired phones (no token hashes), `online` = live WS |
| DELETE | `/devices/:id` | Revoke; drops WS; audit `companion.unpaired` |
| GET | `/status` | `{ok, server:{name,version}, runs[], activeRuns, pendingApprovals}` |
| GET | `/runs` | Unified run list: `{id, kind, label, state, detail}[]` |
| GET | `/approvals` | Pending approvals (mapped from governance) |
| POST | `/approvals/:id/approve` | `{note?}` → decided record; preference learning + MCP close-the-loop, mirroring `/api/approvals` |
| POST | `/approvals/:id/deny` | Same as approve |
| POST | `/runs/:id/pause` | §4 |
| POST | `/runs/:id/resume` | §4 |
| POST | `/runs/:id/cancel` | §4 |
| POST | `/chat/send` | Thin proxy to the local `/api/chat` SSE endpoint (same stream the web UI gets) |
| GET | `/activity` | `?limit=` — Omni `recent` layer; falls back to the live audit feed |
| GET | `/briefing` | Latest briefing mapped to `{title, body, generatedAt}` (+ raw `payload`); 404 when none exists |

Approval `:id` accepts runtime-issued or real gateway ids (translated via
the governance adapter), same as `/api/approvals/:id`.

## 4. Run controls (honest mapping)

The platform has no generic "pause a run" primitive — the web UI offers
only Stop. The companion exposes what actually exists:

- **Run kinds** in `GET /runs`: `chat-turn` (in-flight turn or companion-
  paused session), `queued-message` (chat queue FIFO), `workflow-run`
  (read-only here).
- **`cancel`**:
  - `chat-turn` → aborts the in-flight turn (exactly the web UI Stop
    button) and clears any pause mark. Audit `companion.run_cancelled`.
  - `queued-message` → dequeues it (`chatQueueStore.remove`).
  - `workflow-run` → 409 `not_supported` (no remote cancel primitive in
    this MVP).
- **`pause`** (chat-turn only): aborts the in-flight turn if any, then marks
  the session paused. While paused, **new turns on that session are rejected
  with 423** (same pattern as paused Spaces); queued messages simply wait.
  Audit `companion.run_paused`.
- **`resume`** (chat-turn only): clears the pause mark; the app can then
  send the next message on the session. Audit `companion.run_resumed`.
- `pause`/`resume` on `queued-message` or `workflow-run` → 409
  `not_supported` with the reason. Runs paused *for approval* resume when
  their approval is decided via the approvals endpoints — that is the
  platform's real resume path.
- Pause marks are in-memory: a server restart clears them (documented
  limitation, same as pending OTTs).

Unknown run id → 404 `run_not_found`.

## 5. Push channel (`/api/companion/ws`)

- Connect: `ws://<host>:<port>/api/companion/ws?token=<deviceToken>`.
  The token is verified **before** the 101 upgrade; invalid/missing → the
  socket is destroyed after a `401` response (never upgraded).
- First message must be `{t:'hello'}` → `{type:'hello', ok:true, deviceId,
  snapshot:{pendingApprovals, activeRuns}}`. `{t:'ping'}` → `{type:'pong'}`.
  Unknown/malformed → `{type:'error', detail}` (socket stays open).
- Server → phone pushes (the app dispatches on `type`):
  - `{type:'run-status', run:{id, workflowId, state}}` — on every workflow
    run update.
  - `{type:'approval', event:'created'|'decided', approval:{...}}` — approval
    lifecycle, wherever it was raised (web chat, workflow, MCP).
  - `{type:'activity', summary}` — hint that something worth refetching
    happened; the app refetches `GET /activity`.
  - `{type:'ping', ts}` — application heartbeat every 30s (in addition to
    WS ping/pong).
- Reconnect-safe: auth is stateless (long-lived token); on reconnect the
  app sends `hello` and gets a fresh snapshot. The app reconnects with
  exponential backoff (1s → 60s cap + jitter).

## 6. Audit

Every remote action is audit-logged (`companion.*` namespace, visible in
the Activity tab): pairing events, WS connect/disconnect/auth failures,
unpair, approval decisions (with `decidedBy: companion:<deviceId>`),
run pause/resume/cancel, chat sends. Chat audits carry metadata only
(device, bot, session, message length) — never message content. Push
payloads are never logged.

## 7. Threat model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Remote pairing by a stranger | OTT is single-use, 5-min expiry, only obtainable by scanning the QR on the user's own screen; exchange is IP rate-limited. |
| Token theft (network / logs / backups) | Token shown once; server stores SHA-256 hash only, constant-time compare. Raw token never in logs or audit. |
| Stolen token → silent PC control | Same exposure as the web UI itself (which has no login in the MVP). Revoke from Workspace → Devices kills the token and drops live sockets instantly. |
| Brute-forcing OTTs | 128-bit entropy; single-use; max 5 pending; 10 exchange attempts / 10 min / IP. |
| WS hijack without a token | Token verified before the 101 upgrade; failures audit-logged, socket destroyed. |
| A paused session being driven anyway | 423 enforced server-side in the `/api/chat` handler, not just hidden in the app. |
| Approval CSRF / confused deputy | Bearer token required; decision audited with `decidedBy: companion:<deviceId>`; 404/409 guards on already-decided approvals. |
| Push socket resource exhaustion | One lightweight framing implementation (no deps); 16 MB frame cap; heartbeat is unref'd so it never holds the process open. |

### Production expectations (NOT yet implemented)

- **TLS**: the MVP binds LAN without TLS — tokens, approvals and chat
  content travel in cleartext on the local network. Any deployment beyond a
  trusted LAN must terminate TLS (https/wss) first. This is pre-production
  work, same as remote-phone v1.
- The web UI has no login in the MVP — anyone who can reach the API has the
  web UI's powers. The companion token adds a per-device credential on top,
  but it does not make the API itself multi-user safe.
- Push delivery is best-effort: if the socket drops, the app polls
  `/status`, `/approvals`, `/activity` on its own cadence.

## 8. Notes for the Android app workstream

- Chat: the app's `streamChat` currently targets `/chat`; the server exposes
  the endpoint at **`/api/chat`** — call `POST /api/chat` (with the Bearer
  device token) or the namespaced proxy `POST /api/companion/chat/send`.
  Both return the same SSE contract (`token` / `approval_required` / `done`
  / `error` events, `: ping` heartbeats; JSON `{ok, queued}` when a turn is
  in-flight with `queueMode: 'queue'`).
- `GET /api/companion/runs` exists (the app already calls it) in addition
  to the `runs` array inside `GET /status`.
- `exchangePairing` returns `{deviceToken, deviceId}` — the app also
  accepts a bare `token` field, but `deviceToken` is canonical.
- There is no conversation-history endpoint yet; the app should keep its
  own local chat history (the platform stores sessions internally without
  a clean REST read path).

## 9. Hosted mode — pair over the internet

When Sarviq runs on a hosted machine (VPS, home server) instead of the PC
beside you, the companion app can still pair — over the internet, not the
LAN.

**Server setup**

1. Put the API behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS (the device
   token is a bearer credential — it must never travel as plain HTTP).
   Example nginx config (cert via `certbot --nginx -d sarviq.example.com`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name sarviq.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/sarviq.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/sarviq.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # The API listens on 127.0.0.1:4000 by default.
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # WebSocket upgrades: the companion push channel at
        # /api/companion/ws (and remote-phone at /api/phone/ws).
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;

        # Long-lived push sockets.
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    }
}
```

2. Start the API with the public URL so pairing QRs encode it:

```
SARVIQ_PUBLIC_URL=https://sarviq.example.com bun src/index.ts
```

   (Trailing slashes are stripped; anything that is not an `http(s)://`
   URL with a host is ignored with a warning and pairing stays LAN-only.)

**What changes**

- `POST /api/companion/pairing/code` and `GET /api/companion/pairing/qr`
  return the hosted QR flavor
  (`sarviq://pair?url=<public-url>&token=<ott>`) with
  `mode: 'hosted'` and `serverLabel: '<public-url>'`. Without
  `SARVIQ_PUBLIC_URL`, responses are exactly as before (`mode: 'lan'`).
- The pairing handshake is otherwise identical — OTT single-use, exchange
  for a device token, Bearer auth on every route — because it is plain
  HTTPS; there are no LAN-only assumptions in the pairing or device code
  paths.
- The app connects its push socket as
  `wss://sarviq.example.com/api/companion/ws?token=<deviceToken>` (https
  upgrades to wss automatically). The server honors `X-Forwarded-Proto` /
  `X-Forwarded-Host` (`trust proxy` is enabled) so scheme/host-dependent
  behavior stays correct behind the proxy.
- The web UI (Workspace → Devices) shows which network the QR encodes and
  hints at `SARVIQ_PUBLIC_URL` when in LAN mode.

**Security notes for hosted mode**

- TLS is mandatory, not optional: without it, device tokens, approvals
  and chat content travel in cleartext across the internet. The server
  logs a warning if `SARVIQ_PUBLIC_URL` is plain `http`.
- The QR / 6-digit code is still a short-lived secret (5-minute OTT):
  treat it like a password — only scan/type it into your own phone. In
  hosted mode the "physical proximity" assumption of LAN pairing is
  weaker (a code could be relayed by message), so prefer the QR scan and
  revoke unknown devices from Workspace → Devices.
- Pairing and WS auth failures are IP rate-limited and audit-logged
  (`companion.*`); the limiter keys off `X-Forwarded-For` behind a proxy.
