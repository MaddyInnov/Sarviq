// Playwright-backed OS layer — the browser window is the "display".
//
// This is the open-dots-style computer runtime option: instead of driving
// the physical desktop (robotjs + screenshot-desktop, see computer-real.ts),
// the agent drives a REAL Chromium browser launched by Playwright. This is
// valuable where the robotjs route is impractical: Playwright is pure
// JavaScript (no C++ toolchain / node-gyp like robotjs) and it bundles its
// own browser, so `npm install playwright && npx playwright install
// chromium` is the whole install story. It is also the natural fit for
// browser-automation tasks (the agent's "computer" IS the browser).
//
// SAFETY: this layer is NEVER selected by default. selectOSLayer() returns
// it only when COMPUTER_USE_PLAYWRIGHT=1 is set in the environment. Like
// the real foreground layer, every mutating tool call (click/type/key)
// still flows through governance (computerUsePolicyRules() →
// require-approval) before the handler runs — the approval gate is
// orthogonal to which OS layer is active.
//
// The `playwright` package is OPTIONAL and lazy-loaded on first use, so
// merely importing this module (or enabling the env var without the package
// installed) never crashes the process at startup. The first real action
// throws a clear install error instead.
//
// Install (on the machine running the API server):
//   npm install playwright
//   npx playwright install chromium        # downloads the browser build
//
// Env:
//   COMPUTER_USE_PLAYWRIGHT=1      — opt in to this layer
//   COMPUTER_PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT   — "WIDTHxHEIGHT", default "1280x720"
//   COMPUTER_PLAYWRIGHT_URL        — optional page to open at startup
//   COMPUTER_PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS   — "1" (default) or "0" (visible window)
