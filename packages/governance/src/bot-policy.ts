// Per-bot policy merging.
//
// A bot's own rules are PREPENDED to the global policy's rules before
// evaluation. Policy matching is first-match-wins (see
// GovernanceGateway.evaluate and default-policy.ts), so a bot rule can
// tighten the global floor (e.g. deny a tool the global policy would
// allow) or loosen it (e.g. allow a tool the global policy gates behind
// approval) — for that bot only. A bot with no policy evaluates against
// the global policy unchanged.
//
// NOTE: this package cannot import BotConfig from @mvp/agent-runtime (that
// package depends on THIS one), so the bot-policy shapes are declared here
// structurally. They must stay field-compatible with agent-runtime's
// BotPolicyRule/BotPolicy in packages/agent-runtime/src/types.ts.
