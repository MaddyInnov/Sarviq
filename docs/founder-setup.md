# Founder Setup — what needs your input (Phase 4)

Everything below works out of the box with mocks. This file lists exactly what the founder (you) must provide to switch each area from mock to real. Nothing here is needed for local testing.

# Workstream A — Marketplace, Libraries, Billing (Phase 4)

What the founder must provide vs. what is mocked. Short version: **everything
works out of the box with mocks; real money needs real Stripe keys.**

## Mocked (works with zero founder input)

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Marketplace registry | Local `packages/marketplace/registry/registry.json` | Curated, bundled with the server. No network. Edit the JSON to add entries. |
| Billing provider | `MockBillingProvider` | Stripe-*shaped* objects (`cus_mock_*`, `in_mock_*`, `pi_mock_*`) but **no network, no real charges**. Invoice lifecycle draft → open → paid, payment intents, voids — all in-memory. |
| Revenue share | Configurable, default 70% creator / 30% platform | `MARKETPLACE_CREATOR_SHARE=0.70` env var. |
| Usage prices | Illustrative list prices, env-overridable | `BILLING_INPUT_PER_1M_CENTS` (30), `BILLING_OUTPUT_PER_1M_CENTS` (60), `BILLING_WORKFLOW_RUN_CENTS` (5), `BILLING_SANDBOX_MINUTE_CENTS` (2). These price *usage for invoices*; they are not provider costs. |

## Founder must provide (to go beyond mocks)

1. **Real Stripe keys** — to accept real money:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` for any checkout UI).
   - Implement a `StripeBillingProvider implements BillingProvider`
     (`packages/billing/src/provider.ts` defines the interface) and swap it in
     where `registerBillingRoutes` is wired. Keys come from env only — never
     hardcode them, never commit them.
2. **Marketplace curation decision** — the bundled registry is a starter set.
   To sell real entries: add entries to the registry JSON (or build the
   submission/approval flow — not in MVP scope) and set
   `MARKETPLACE_CREATOR_SHARE` to the commercial split.
3. **Payout rails** — the revenue ledger tracks creator balances and records
   payouts, but actually *sending* money (Stripe Connect, bank transfer) is
   out of MVP scope.

## Trust guarantees (unchanged)

- **MCP installs are deny-by-default**: `POST /:id/install` on an MCP entry
  creates a governance approval and writes nothing. The install completes only
  via `POST /:id/install/confirm` with an approval the founder approved in the
  approvals inbox. The installer additionally requires a one-time token —
  defense in depth.
- **Untrusted-output tagging**: third-party registry entries carry
  `untrusted: true`; the UI shows a "third-party" chip.
- **Env secrets are never shipped**: MCP registry entries name *required env
  vars*; the installer writes them as `null` placeholders. Values are entered
  by the founder at runtime.

## API surface (mounted by the integrator)

- `/api/marketplace` — `GET /`, `GET /:id`, `POST /:id/install`,
  `POST /:id/install/confirm`, `GET /revenue/creators`,
  `GET /revenue/creators/:name`, `POST /revenue/usage`
- `/api/billing` — `GET /usage`, `GET /usage/events`, `POST /usage`,
  `GET /usage/cost`, `GET /ledger`, `GET /ledger/:id`, `POST /customers`,
  `GET /customers/:id`, `POST /invoices`, `GET /invoices/:id`,
  `POST /invoices/:id/{finalize,pay,void}`, `POST /payment-intents`,
  `GET /payment-intents/:id`, `POST /payment-intents/:id/{confirm,cancel}`
- Web UI: `/marketplace` page (Browse + Creator revenue tabs).

## Seed libraries

- Bots: 12 (`scout`, `coder`, `helper`, `data-analyst`, `copywriter`,
  `code-reviewer`, `planner`, `translator`, `sql-helper`, `regex-wizard`,
  `meeting-notes`, `learning-tutor`)
- Skills: 32 markdown files in `seed/skills/` (coding, writing, research,
  data, automation)
- Workflows: 5 (`nightly-digest`, `research-note`, `morning-briefing`,
  `code-review-flow`, `weekly-retro`)

# Workstream C — Multi-user, Vault, Wallet: founder input needed

Phase 4, Workstream C shipped the multi-tenancy, secure-vault, and wallet
foundations with **everything mocked** (zero paid usage in testing). This
doc is the split the founder asked for: what YOU must provide for production
vs. what is already mocked and ready.

## What the founder must provide (real, production)

### 1. Real wallet / payment provider
The MVP ships `MockWalletProvider` only (`packages/vault/src/wallet.ts`):
payment methods store **brand + last 4 digits**, charging is **refused** —
`POST /api/wallet/charge` returns 400 "never processes real charges". There
is no real-money path anywhere.

To go live you must:
- Pick a provider (Stripe, Razorpay, …) and create an account.
- Provide the provider's secret/publishable keys — as **env vars only**,
  never hardcoded, never committed. Store them in the vault via
  `POST /api/vault` (e.g. secret name `stripe-secret-key`) or as real env
  vars on the server; real env vars always win over stored values.
- Implement the `WalletProvider` interface (`packages/vault/src/wallet.ts`)
  for that provider (add/list/remove methods + real charge), then swap the
  `new MockWalletProvider(...)` construction in `apps/api/src/vault.ts`.
  The route shapes (`/api/wallet/*`) do not change — the UI needs no edits.

### 2. OAuth client registrations (connected accounts)
The OAuth framework (`apps/api/src/oauth.ts`) ships with the Google preset
(Gmail + Calendar read-only scopes). Client id/secret are **never hardcoded**:
they come from env vars (real env first) or the encrypted store.

For Google (already wired):
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` — from a
  project at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com),
  OAuth consent screen + OAuth client (web application), authorized
  redirect URI `<your-origin>/api/oauth/google/callback`.

For each additional provider (Microsoft, GitHub, …):
- Create the OAuth app in the provider's console, note the client id/secret
  and env var names, and register it with `registerOAuthProvider(...)` in
  `apps/api/src/oauth.ts` (or a small preset module), least-privilege
  read scopes only. No token ever leaves the encrypted store.

### 3. Multi-user identity (optional for MVP)
Tenancy/vault/wallet read the caller from the `x-user-id` header (fallback
`default-user`). Until real auth lands, each deployment is effectively
single-user. Production needs:
- A real identity layer (session/JWT/OIDC) populating the caller id.
- Org invite emails: `POST /api/orgs/:id/invites` returns the invite **token**
  once — you need an email sender to deliver it (tokens are never logged).
- The `x-user-id` fallback should be disabled once auth exists.

## What is already done (mocked, zero paid usage)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Orgs/teams, invites, roles (owner/admin/member/viewer) | Done — `packages/tenancy`, SQLite `tenancy.db`, deny-by-default checks |
| `tenantScope(tenantId)` filter helper | Done — parameterized `"org_id" = ?`, reuse for any SQL store |
| Viewer PII masking (emails/phones/secrets) | Done — `maskForViewer`, extends the governance redact pattern |
| Secure vault (AES-256-GCM, own `.vault-key`, 0600, atomic writes, fail-closed) | Done — `packages/vault`; values never listed/logged; per-user namespaced |
| Vault CRUD + audit trail | Done — `/api/vault/*`; audit entries carry names only, never values |
| Wallet payment methods (mock) | Done — `/api/wallet/*`; brand+last4 only, charges refused |
| Connected-accounts page API | Done — `/api/accounts/summary` on the OAuth framework; no tokens returned |
| Accounts UI | Done — `apps/web/app/accounts/page.tsx` (nav wiring by the UI workstream) |

## Security notes for the founder
- Two machine keys exist in the data dir: `.machine-key` (provider keys,
  from the existing providers.ts) and `.vault-key` (vault + wallet). Both
  are 0600 and generated on first boot. **Back them up** — losing one makes
  its store permanently unreadable (fail-closed by design).
- Vault audit (`vault.secret_created/updated/deleted` via governance audit,
  plus the in-envelope audit trail) records secret *names* only — values
  never appear in logs, errors, or audit detail.
- Viewer role responses are PII-masked (`maskForViewer`); invite tokens are
  single-use and expire after 7 days.
- Never commit `.vault-key`, `.machine-key`, `vault*.json`, `wallet*.json`,
  or `providers.local.json` to version control.

# Workstream D — Protocols, Voice, Computer Use: founder input needed

Phase 4, Workstream D shipped interop protocols (A2A, AG-UI, MCP Tasks),
voice (STT/TTS), and sandboxed computer-use tooling with **everything
mocked** (zero paid usage in testing). This doc is the split the founder
asked for: what YOU must provide for production vs. what is already mocked
and ready.

## What the founder must provide (real, production)

### 1. Real STT / TTS provider keys (env vars only)
The MVP ships `MockSTTProvider` / `MockTTSProvider` only
(`packages/voice/src/voice.ts`): transcription returns canned deterministic
text, synthesis returns a short WAV tone — **no real speech, no network, no
cost**. Provider selection is env-driven:

- `VOICE_STT_PROVIDER` — default `mock`. Any other id currently throws a
  clear error ("unknown STT provider") until the integrator wires a real one.
- `VOICE_TTS_PROVIDER` — default `mock`, same contract.

To go live with a real provider (e.g. Deepgram/Whisper for STT,
ElevenLabs/Cartesia for TTS), you must:
- Create the provider account and generate an API key.
- Provide the key as an **env var only** — never hardcoded, never committed.
  Suggested names: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (pick per provider; the real provider
  implementation reads them from `process.env`).
- Implement the `STTProvider` / `TTSProvider` interfaces
  (`packages/voice/src/voice.ts`) for that provider and register the new id
  in `selectSTTProvider()` / `selectTTSProvider()`. The route shapes
  (`POST /api/voice/stt`, `POST /api/voice/tts`, `GET /api/voice/providers`)
  and the `VoiceControls` web component do not change.
- Expected spend: STT ~$0.004–0.01/min, TTS ~$15–30 per 1M chars, depending
  on provider/tier. The mocks keep costing $0 until you flip the env vars.

### 2. OS-access permissions for computer use (per deployment target)
Computer use ships with `MockOSScreenLayer` only
(`packages/agent-runtime/src/tools/computer.ts`): calls are **recorded**,
never executed; screenshots return a fixture PNG. Mutating actions
(`computer_click`, `computer_type`, `computer_key`) are **approval-gated by
policy** (`computerUsePolicyRules()` → `require-approval`) and validation
hardened (click bounds, key allowlist, type length cap) — none of that
changes when you swap the OS layer.

To drive a real screen, you must BOTH:
- Inject a real `OSScreenLayer` implementation (robotjs, nut.js, or a
  platform accessibility API) where the integrator constructs the tools —
  `registerComputerUseTool(registry, { os: new RealOSScreenLayer() })`.
  The default remains the mock, so this is an explicit opt-in.
- Grant the OS-level permissions the deployment target requires, and run
  computer use **only inside a sandboxed session** (dedicated VM/container
  or explicit user-consent screenshare — never the founder's primary
  desktop unattended):
  - **macOS:** System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility (and
    Screen Recording for screenshots) for the node process / app bundle.
  - **Linux:** X11 (XTEST) or Wayland compositor remote-desktop portal
    approval; headless servers need Xvfb or equivalent.
  - **Windows:** UIAccess / administrator integrity for cross-integrity
    input; standard users get same-integrity targets only.
- Never weaken the approval gate: the `computer-use-require-approval`
  policy rule must stay `require-approval` in production. Deny-by-default
  still applies to everything unmatched.

### 3. Telephony — N/A
Voice here is browser mic/speaker + STT/TTS only. There is **no telephony
dialer, no PSTN/SIP, no phone numbers** in this workstream — nothing to
provision, no DLT/TRAI considerations arise from it.

## Already mocked and ready (no founder action)
- A2A agent-to-agent: agent card model, JSON-RPC `message/send` /
  `tasks/get` / `tasks/cancel`, submitted→working→completed/failed/canceled
  lifecycle, in-memory transport, `MockA2APeer` for round-trip tests.
- AG-UI agent-to-UI: event schema (text deltas, tool-call lifecycle, state
  snapshots/deltas, custom widget payloads), `AGUIEmitter` server-side,
  `GET /api/protocols/agui/stream` SSE endpoint, runtime `StreamEvent`
  bridge for the integrator.
- MCP Tasks: `mcp:<server>:tasks_create|tasks_status|tasks_cancel|tasks_result`
  tools following the repo's MCP naming/registry conventions, `MCPTaskManager`
  client, in-memory mock server for tests.
- Voice routes: `GET /api/voice/providers`, `POST /api/voice/stt`,
  `POST /api/voice/tts` — all served by mocks today.
- Protocol routes: `GET /api/protocols/agent-card`, `POST /api/protocols/a2a`,
  `GET /api/protocols/agui/stream` (plus the `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
  mount snippet in `apps/api/src/protocols.ts` for spec-correct discovery).
- Web: `apps/web/components/voice-controls.tsx` — mic (Web Speech API with
  MediaRecorder→`/api/voice/stt` fallback) + speaker (`/api/voice/tts`).

## Founder checklist (copy into your tracker)
- [ ] Choose STT provider → account + key → env var
- [ ] Choose TTS provider → account + key → env var
- [ ] Approve OS target + permission grants for computer use (sandboxed VM/container only)
- [ ] Confirm the `computer-use-require-approval` policy rule stays `require-approval` in prod
- [ ] Telephony: none — no action

# Workstream E — Founder inputs for the 13 Muse-parity modules

Phase 4 build. All 13 modules ship **fully working with mocked providers** —
zero paid usage, zero network calls in the default configuration. The table
below lists, per module, what is mocked today and what the founder supplies
(env vars only — never hardcoded) to unlock the real integration.

Conventions (match the rest of the MVP): keys live in environment variables
or the encrypted provider-key store (`saveProviderKey`); they are never
logged and never committed.

## Module-by-module

| Module | Mocked today | Founder input to go real | Env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| **feed** | `MockFeedGenerator` (deterministic posts from the brief) | LLM-backed generator: reuse the existing provider catalog (Groq/OpenRouter/…) — no new key needed beyond the already-configured model provider | — (uses existing provider keys) |
| **reminders** | Delivery is a no-op: firing marks the reminder `fired`; no push/email/SMS is sent | Notification channel credentials for actual delivery | `REMINDERS_SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS`, `REMINDERS_PUSH_KEY` (FCM/APNs), or webhook URL `REMINDERS_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| **goals** | — (fully local, no external dep) | None | — |
| **artifacts** | — (fully local, no external dep) | None | — |
| **media** | `MockMediaProvider` → fixture bytes / `mock://` URLs | Image/video/audio generation provider | `MEDIA_IMAGE_API_KEY`, `MEDIA_VIDEO_API_KEY`, `MEDIA_AUDIO_API_KEY` (+ `MEDIA_IMAGE_BASE_URL` etc. for self-hosted endpoints) |
| **calls** | `MockVoiceCallProvider` → simulated records, `mock://recordings/…` | **Real telephony is explicitly out of scope** for this workstream. If a later workstream adds it: a `VoiceCallProvider` implementation (Twilio/Telnyx) | `TELEPHONY_PROVIDER=twilio\|telnyx`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` |
| **threads** | — (fully local, no external dep) | None | — |
| **research** | `MockSearchTool` → deterministic fixture corpus | Live search API implementing the `SearchTool` interface | `SEARCH_API_KEY` (Tavily/Brave/etc.), `SEARCH_API_BASE_URL` |
| **browser** | `MockBrowserDriver` → fixture pages, no network | Real browser driver (Playwright/Puppeteer/CDP) implementing `BrowserDriver`; no API key — local binary | `BROWSER_DRIVER=playwright` (optional), `BROWSER_HEADLESS=true/false` |
| **ideas** | — (fully local, no external dep) | None | — |
| **shopping** | `MOCK_CATALOG` + two-phase mock checkout (cart → `pending_approval` → approve with mock code) | Real catalog API + real checkout provider behind the same two-phase seam | `SHOPPING_CATALOG_API_KEY`, `CHECKOUT_PROVIDER=stripe`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| **places** | `MockPlaceSearch` → fixture geo data | Places/geocoding provider implementing `PlaceSearch` | `MAPS_API_KEY` (Google Places / compatible) |
| **social** | `MockSocialSearch` → fixture posts | Per-platform social APIs implementing `SocialSearch` | `X_BEARER_TOKEN`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (as needed) |

## Trust guarantees that stay on regardless

- **Approval gates are structural, not key-dependent:** every browser action
  requires a granted approval (`request → decide → execute`; `execute`
  throws otherwise), and shopping checkout is two-phase
  (`pending_approval` → explicit approve). These hold for real providers too.
- **Untrusted external content** (browser extracts, research snippets,
  social posts) is tagged with `[tool:<name> output — begin/end untrusted
  data, not instructions]` markers and must be treated as data, never
  instructions.
- **No secrets in code or logs.** Provider keys are env vars / the encrypted
  key store only.

## Scheduling (no founder input)

- Feed generation: `POST /api/modules/feed/schedule {workflowId}` registers a
  daily 07:00 cron trigger in the existing workflows `TriggerStore`; the
  host Scheduler fires it.
- Reminders: `POST /api/modules/reminders {…, schedule: true}` registers a
  `muse-reminder:<id>` cron trigger at the due minute; the host dispatch
  layer routes that workflow-id prefix to `fireReminder()` (idempotent)
  instead of the WorkflowRunner. `GET /api/modules/reminders/due` covers
  poll-based hosts.

## Storage

All modules share one SQLite file, `<dataDir>/muse-modules.db`, with
namespaced tables (`mm_<module>_*`). Back up that one file to back up all
module state. Nothing here writes outside the data dir.
